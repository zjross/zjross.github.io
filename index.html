<p>Hi! My name is Zachary Ross and I am an engineering student at the University at Buffalo. I am majoring in computer science and hope to graduate in the year 2020 with my Bachelor's degree. I wanted to become a computer scientist because I want to be able to influence the world in some way, and I think the growing influence of computer technology in our lives is something I can actively participate in. While I'm not the best computer scientist yet, I am working hard on learning new skills while striving to find a career in computer science that is enjoyable and has an impact on our world.
